	// That being said, as a general rule is fair to assume that in most cases
	// the following things take place:
	//
	// 1. The default logic, if not overridden by the node is to consider nodes
	// equal if they have the all of the same; tag, value and pointer.
	//
	// 2. If either side is nil (or both) the nodes are never considered equal.
	//
	// 3. If both nodes are different types they are not considered equal.
	//
	// 4. Despite being a shallow equality test some nodes need to check the
	// equality some children to make a determination. For example, a BirthNode
	// is always equal to another BirthNode, even if they contain different
	// children or dates. Whereas a ResidenceNode is only considered equal if
	// they both contain at least one DateNode with exactly the same value.
	//
	// The rules above play heavily into the logic of other things, such as
	// CompareNodes.

// DeepEqual tests if left and right are recursively equal.
//
// If either left or right is nil (including both) then false is always
// returned.
//
// If left does not equal right (see Node.Equals) or both sides do not contain
// exactly the same amount of child nodes then false is returned.
//
// The GEDCOM standard allows nodes to appear in any order. So the children are
// compared in this way as well. For example the following root nodes are equal:
//
//   0 INDI @P1@        |  0 INDI @P1@
//   1 BIRT             |  1 BIRT
//   2 DATE 3 SEP 1943  |  2 PLAC England
//   2 PLAC England     |  2 DATE 3 SEP 1943
//
// DeepEqual heavily depends on the logic of the Equals method for each kind of
// node. Equals may or may not take into consideration child nodes to determine
// if the parent itself is equal. You should see the specific documentation for
// Equals on each node type.
//
// If Equals is not implemented it will fall back to SimpleNode.Equals.

// appear the same number of times on the opposite side for the DeepEqual to be
// true.
