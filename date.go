// You should be careful about directly creating dates from the defined instance
// variables because they may contain 0 to signify that a date component was not
// provided. Unless you have a very special case you should use Time() to
// convert to a usable date.

	// IsEndOfRange signifies is this date is the start or end of the range

	// important in some cases to know the date may not be the value returned by

// Years returns the number of years of a date as a floating-point. It can be
// used as an approximation to get a general idea of how far apart dates are but

//
// The smallest date unit in a GEDCOM is a day. For specific dates it is
// calculated as the number of days that have past, divided by the number of
// days in that year (to correct for leap years). For example "10 Oct 2009"
// would return 2009.860274.
//
// Since some date components can be missing (like the day or month) Years
// compensates by returning the midpoint (average) of the maximum and minimum
// value in days. For example the date "Mar 1945" is the equivalent to the
// average Years value of "1 Mar 1945" and "31 Mar 1945", returning 1945.205479.
//
// When only a year is provided 0.5 will be added to the year. For example,
// "1845" returns 1845.5. This is not the exact midpoint of the year but will be
// close enough for general calculations. You should not rely on 0.5 being
// returned (as part of a check) as this may change in the future.
//
// The value returned from Years is not effected by any other component of the
// date. Such as if the date is approximate ("Abt.", etc) or directional
// ("Bef.", "Aft.", etc). If this property is important to you will need to take
// it into account in an appropriate way.
