// Similarity calculates how similar two collections of individuals are. The
// individuals could be children of the same parents, spouses that share the
// same partner or some other similar group of individuals.
//
// Individuals that have a similarity below minimumSimilarity will not be
// considered a match. Making this a larger value will lead to less
// false-positives but also cause more true-negatives. You can use the
// DefaultMinimumSimilarity constant if you are unsure.
//
// As a rule of thumb you should not trust a return value of 0.5 of less as any
// kind of match. 0.7 and above is getting in the range of what is likely to be
// considered the same.
//
// Although there is no theoretical limit to the amount of individuals that can
// be compared, this function invokes a complex chain of comparisons that can be
// very CPU intensive. It is not a good idea to use it compare a large amount of
// individuals, like an entire file.
//
// If both slices have zero elements then 1.0 is returned. However, if one slice
// is not empty then 0.5 is returned. 0.5 is actually the same value that would
// be returned in all cases if the logic were to fall through.
//
// The algorithm works through several stages explained in more detail below but
// the basic principle is this:
//
// 1. Find an individual from both slices that have the highest similarity.
// There similarity is added to a total. These individuals are now excluded from
// the next pass.
//
// 2. Repeat the first step until one of the list runs out of individuals.
//
// 3. Increase the number of matched individuals to the length of the largest
// slice by using the score 0.5 for each individual.
//
// 4. Take the average. The total score (including the 0.5 for padding
// individuals) and divide it by the maximum slice size.
//
// The easiest way to explain how the process works is by working through an
// example. Consider the two following slices of individuals:
//
//   [a, b, c]
//   [d, e]
//
// There is 5 individuals in total, but the largest slice length is 3.
//
// The first step is to calculate the individual similarity matrix between the
// inputs. This is the expensive part because it takes O(nm) time where n and m
// are the slice lengths respectively. The results may look like:
//
//   a.Similarity(d) = 0.234
//   a.Similarity(e) = 0.123
//   b.Similarity(d) = 0.546
//   b.Similarity(e) = 0.678
//   c.Similarity(d) = 0.235
//   c.Similarity(e) = 0.456
//
// The results are sorted by their similarity score, highest first:
//
//   b.Similarity(e) = 0.678
//   b.Similarity(d) = 0.546
//   c.Similarity(e) = 0.456
//   c.Similarity(d) = 0.235
//   a.Similarity(d) = 0.234
//   a.Similarity(e) = 0.123
//
// In reality the scores should be closer to 1.0 for many of the individuals,
// but I will use a wide range of values for this example.
//
// The above list states that individual "b" is the most similar individual to
// "e". So we should consider these a match, and record the fact that "b" and
// "e" are matched.
//
// Moving on to the second iteration, "b" has already been matched. Even though
// "d" has not we still skip this iteration. The same is true for the third
// iteration, since "e" has already been matched.
//
// The forth iteration is the first time we see two new individuals, "c" and
// "d". For the second time we consider these two to be a match.
//
// The process continues and can be visualised like this:
//
//   b.Similarity(e) = 0.678   b = e
//   b.Similarity(d) = 0.546   b already matched
//   c.Similarity(e) = 0.456   e already matched
//   c.Similarity(d) = 0.235   c = d
//   a.Similarity(d) = 0.234   d already matched
//   a.Similarity(e) = 0.123   e already matched
//
// There should be the same amount of matches as the smallest slice size. As we
// can see the two matches is the same number as the smallest slice.
//
// Finally, we pad out the remaining individuals with a score of 0.5 so that the
// total matches equals the longest slice. Using a middle-score (and not 0.0) is
// important because 0.0 would represent that individuals were a complete
// non-match and throw out the final score quite heavily. We must treat missing
// individuals as neither a perfect or non-match because we simply don't have
// the information to make the call either way, hence 0.5.
//
// The returned score is now the average:
//
//   (0.678 + 0.234 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.4707
//
// There are some known caveats to the algorithm:
//
// When calculating the similarity of individuals where data is missing from
// both sides (such as both individuals having a missing birth date) then the
// result will be less than 1.0 even though the individuals are arguably the
// same.
//
// This is designed this way on purpose as to not so eagerly match individuals
// with incomplete information. Otherwise these would take a higher score for
// matches of individuals that have a slightly different birth date.
//
// The options.MaxYears allows the error margin on dates to be adjusted. See
// DefaultMaxYearsForSimilarity for more information.
